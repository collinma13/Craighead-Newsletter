      Craighead Junior Athletics Champion Charlotte Blake was the youngest competitor at the Canterbury Senior Athletics
      Championships, held in February. Charlotte won the Girlsâ€™ U16 Javelin, Shot put and Discus finals, an outstanding
      effort across three events against girls much older than she.

      She also took part in the Canterbury Quadrathon, a mini Pentathlon / Heptathlon, where athletes compete in four
      events over 3 1/2 hours, the winner being the athlete who performs to the highest standard across all four
      disciplines. Charlotte won her division against 36 competitors, with a total of 2096 points.
